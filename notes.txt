How do we handle the Alerts in Cypress?
    - Cypress by default handles the Warning and Confirmation alerts by clicking the Okay. 
    - Cypress does not handle the Prompt Alert because it assumes input must be entered by the user.

We don't handle warning and confirmation alerts, but if we want to interact with there ddialogs, we have to use cy.on event listener.

cy.on()
    - It's an event listener that listens specific event that triggered by the browser, and handle it if its needed
    - Examples: cy.on('window:alert') , cy.on('window:confirm')

How to handle Prompt alerts in cypress?
    - First, we have to call the prompt method, which is instance of a windows object in JS. After, ew need to use cy.stub() method that is coming from the Sinon bundled library which will alllow us to replace the functionaltof original prompt method.

    - cy.window().then((win) => {
        cy.stub(win, 'prompt').returns('My Input')
    })

    ** if you want to cancel, return false or null in your function **


Keyboard and Mouse actions in Cypress
    - Cypress Keyboard or mouse actions are simulated which are actually fired from JavaScript. For this reason, while using any cypress UI interaction methods, we might end up having errors.

        - To fix this issue, its suggested to install library called 'real-events' from npm. This library creates user actions usig CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) which is pretty much same as real user actions.
